# Low detail (high level) description of software

## Pargraph 1
Here we describe a software pipeline that combines the results of user centered design and visual best practices with data processing and psychological theory to produce feedback tailored for each recipient.

The software process perform data processing, semantic reasoning, and image generation to create a tailored feedback figure for each recipient.

It is the complimentary computational process to the human centered processes that assess the recipient organization and sets the parameters for tailoring feedback.

## Paragraph 2
The software begins by reading the perofrmance data and making inferences about each performer such as "has capability barrier" or "has upward performance trend".

It then considers the characteristics of each performer in conjunction with each of the possible performance feedback displays supplied from the user centered design.

For each performer, the inferred characteristics along with any apriori characteristics are used to determine which feedback displays are acceptable.

A simple concensus scoring heuristic is applied to the acceptable displays to select a single display for each perfomer.

Finally, the software generates the selected feedback display for each perfomer.
