- Background
  - generationg appropriate feedback is desired
  - psychological theory about acceptable | appropriate feedback
  - user centered design to collect details about recipients and their environment
  - visual design practices to create attractive and consistent displays
- Problem: How to combine theory, user centered design, visual desing, and data proc. to create appropriate feedback for each recipient
- Overview: Given perf data, environment specific annotations, dispaly templates, and causal pathways, create appropriate feedback for each recipient
- Process
  1. Start with results of user centered design and visual design
    - applicable causal pathways
    - applicable display templates
    - information about recipients
  1. process perf data to make inferences about each recipient.
  1. combine attrs of performs with attrs of templates to create feedback candidates
    - cartesian product of performers and templates
  1. apply causal pathway preconditions to annotate each candidate for appropriateness
  1. apply cuaual pathway moderators to generate intra-pathway scores
  1. generate figure specified by the top scoring candidate by each causal pathway
  1. science! eval the acceptability & appropriateness of candidates by recipients
- Figures
  - anatomy of a feedback candidate
  - example causual pathway
  - causal pathway - candidate processing
